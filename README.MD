# Hive / Openhab2 / Ruby examples and scripts

This is just a few scripts I put together for the most recent version of the hive API. Based on work from https://github.com/josephdouce/rubygem-BritishGasHive but updated for the 6.5 api

The scripts to output the temperatures/status are VERY basic and I would recommend doing something much more sophisticated with them!

Example items and things files are for openhab2 and require the Exec2.0 binding
